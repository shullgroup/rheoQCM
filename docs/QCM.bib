The acoustic load acting at the surface of the resonator is a more general parameter to describe this dependence. It can be represented by a mass factor and an acoustic factor. The quotient of resistance increase and frequency shift can be used for the determination of the acoustic factor, if the loss tangent of the coating is known. Viscoelastic properties of sensitive coatings can enhance the mass sensitivity of quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensors.

Acoustic amplification with a viscoelastic film and chemical sensitivity is separated. With a proper selection of materials, the first layer realizes acoustic amplification while the (chemical) sensitive layer acts as a pure mass detector. Major sensor design parameters are the shear modulus and the thickness of the first layer; major challenge is the preparation of a homogeneous and uniform first film.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The corrosion of CoCrMo, an alloy frequently used in orthopedic implants, was studied with an electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) in three physiologically relevant solutions. Mass changes were measured during potentiodynamic tests, showing material deposition in protein solutions at potential levels that caused mass loss when the proteins were not present. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data indicated that the deposited material was primarily organic and therefore was most likely derived from proteins in the electrolyte. Material deposition consistently occurred at a critical potential and was not dependent on the current density or total charge released into solution. Corrosion studies on pure Co, Cr, and Mo in protein solutions found material deposition only on Mo. We hypothesize that organic deposition results from the interaction of Mo(VI) with proteins in the surrounding solution. The organic layer is reminiscent of tribochemical reaction layers that form on the surface of CoCrMo hip bearings, suggesting that these types of layers can be formed by purely electrochemical means.},

	abstract = {We report on the application of piezoelectric quartz-crystal resonators to the viscoelastic characterization of thin organic layers. A passive measurement of the crystal's electrical impedance allows one to determine the frequencies of its resonances as well as the corresponding damping constants. The accessible resonances span a frequency range from about 4 MHz to about 100 MHz. A parallel ellipsometer setup is used for the simultaneous determination of optical thicknesses. When one side of the quartz plate is coated with a viscoelastic layer, the frequencies and the damping constants of the acoustic modes change. While in the limit of ultrathin films these changes depend only on the mass, thicker films show pronounced viscoelastic effects. We inverted these dependences to obtain the complex and anisotropic shear compliance of a film with a thickness of about 1.75 {\textmu}m. Results are presented for a Langmuir-Bodgett-Kuhn film consisting of the molecular composite poly( gamma -methyl-L-glutamate-co- gamma -n-octadecyl-L-glutamate). These rodlike molecules have a rigid backbone and flexible side chains. With respect to its mechanical and rheological behavior the substance is frequently called a ``molecularly reinforced liquid.'' The results show that the large-scale viscoelastic behavior is not a liquidlike one, as would have been suggested by simple composite models. A possible interpretation is the existence of vitrified states in the side-chain regions.},

	abstract = {An analysis is developed for the frequency response of a quartz crystal resonator (often referred to as a quartz crystal microbalance) that is modified with a grafted solvent-swollen polymer brush and placed in contact with a membrane capping layer. The shear wave generated at the resonator surface couples into the membrane layer with an efficiency that is strongly dependent on the thickness of the swollen brush layer. As a result, the resonant frequency changes by a maximum amount that is closely approximated by the Sauerbrey shift for the capping layer. The calculated shift substantially decreases for increases in the brush thickness of approximately 10 nm, which gives a net frequency response that is extremely sensitive to the degree of swelling of the polymer brush. An optimum capping layer thickness is determined by balancing the Sauerbrey shift against dissipative effects that weaken the crystal resonance. This optimum membrane thickness depends only weakly on the properties of the membrane material and is in the micron range. Detailed multilayer calculations are presented for the specific case of a poly(ethylene glycol) brush swollen with water and brought into contact with an elastomeric water-permeable membrane. These calculations confirm that the method is sensitive to the properties of the brush layer in the experimentally relevant thickness regime. Connections are also made to conceptually simpler two and three layer models of the acoustic impedance of the material systems that are brought into contact with the resonator.},

The significantly lower maximum volume fraction, Phi(m) = 0.47, of the SN E-10 powder was referred to the narrow particle size distribution and the possibility of an unfavorable particle morphology.},

The character of the solid/liquid transition is maintained when the gels are filled with solid particles at volume fractions as large as 0.55, so that these are excellent model systems for studying the elastic properties of highly filled elastic solids. The fracture strength of the filled gels exceeds the modulus of the base gel by a factor of 100 or more, while the viscosity at high temperatures remains remarkably low. Stress relaxation experiments are used to probe the added dissipation effects due to the localized increased strain around the particles on the long time relaxation of the filled gels under a constant strain. A thermoreversible gelcasting technique with broad applications for materials processing is described as one practical application of the ideal solid/liquid transition exhibited by these materials.},

	abstract = {By analyzing the frequency shifts and bandwidths of coated quartz resonators the viscoelastic coefficients of the coatings may be derived. The paper gives an overview of the experimental procedure and the data analysis. Some examples of the application of this technique in the range of soft condensed matter are described. The swelling and plastification of polymer films in solvent vapor was monitored in-situ. We reported on measurements of the acoustic thickness of polymer brushes, the thickness of which varies with the solvent quality. The acoustic thickness is significantly larger than the optical thickness because the dilute outer portions of the swollen layer affects the acoustic behavior of the brush much more than the optical behavior. Sandwiching polymer layers between quartz plates and rigid overlayers expands the range of the applicability of the technique at the end of low film thicknesses, because the rigid overlayer adds inertia to the composite film and therefore enhances the stress acting on the layer of interest. Finally, the combination with optical birefringence measurements in Fabry-Perot configuration gives access to the stress-birefringence inside the polymer film. Normal stress components proportional to the square of the oscillation amplitude have been measured for the first time.},

	volume = {34},
	abstract = {A review with 44 refs. The quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) was first introduced as a mass sensor in gas phase and in vacuum. Since oscillator circuits capable of exciting shear vibrations of quartz resonators under liq. loading have been developed, the QCM became accepted as a new, powerful technique to follow adsorption processes at solid-liq. interfaces in chem. and biol. research. Lately, the QCM technique has attracted considerable interest as a novel means to monitor cell-substrate interactions of mammalian cells in vitro. Because the establishment and modulation of cell-substrate contacts is important for many physiol. processes, and potent techniques to measure these interactions noninvasively are rare, the present review highlights applications of the QCM technique in this field. The suitability of the QCM device to monitor attachment and spreading of mammalian cells in real time has been well established. The QCM response is dependent on the individual cell type that is examd. In order to identify the sources for these cell-type-specific results of QCM readings, and to understand the information content of the signal, attempts have been made to decomp. the overall QCM response into subcellular contributions. The aforementioned subjects, together with a condensed introduction into the QCM technol., are included in this article. [on SciFinder (R)]},

	abstract = {Metal-on-metal (MoM) bearings are at the forefront in hip resurfacing arthroplasty. Because of their good wear characteristics and design flexibility, MoM bearings are gaining wider acceptance with market share reaching nearly 10\% worldwide. However, concerns remain regarding potential detrimental effects of metal particulates and ion release. Growing evidence is emerging that the local cell response is related to the amount of debris generated by these bearing couples. Thus, an urgent clinical need exists to delineate the mechanisms of debris generation to further reduce wear and its adverse effects. In this study, we investigated the microstructural and chemical composition of the tribochemical reaction layers forming at the contacting surfaces of metallic bearings during sliding motion. Using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy with coupled energy dispersive X-ray and electron energy loss spectroscopy, we found that the tribolayers are nanocrystalline in structure, and that they incorporate organic material stemming from the synovial fluid. This process, which has been termed {\textquotedblleft}mechanical mixing,{\textquotedblright} changes the bearing surface of the uppermost 50 to 200 nm from pure metallic to an organic composite material. It hinders direct metal contact (thus preventing adhesion) and limits wear. This novel finding of a mechanically mixed zone of nanocrystalline metal and organic constituents provides the basis for understanding particle release and may help in identifying new strategies to reduce MoM wear. {\textcopyright} 2009 Orthopaedic Research Society.

The change in viscoelasticity was studied after addition of Cu2+ and Mn2+, which theoretically could induce metal complex formation with 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) moieties. We also used NaIO4, a nonmetal oxidative agent known to induce di-DOPA formation. Reduction in viscoelasticity of adsorbed Mefp-1 followed the order of NaIO4 {\textgreater} Cu2+ {\textgreater} buffer control {\textgreater} Mn2+. We also studied the formation of molecular aggregates of Mefp-1 in solution with the use of dynamic light scattering (DLS). We found that addition of Cu2+, but not Mn2+, induced the formation of larger DLS-detectable aggregates. Minor aggregate formation was found with NaIO4. With the analytical resolution of small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), we could detect differences in the molecular structure between NaIO4- and Cu2+-treated Mefp-1 aggregates. We concluded from this study that Cu2+ could participate in intermolecular cross-linking of the Mefp-1 molecule via metal complex formation. Metal incorporation in the protein most likely increases the abrasion resistance of the Mefp-1 layer. NaIO4, on the other hand, resulted in mainly intramolecular formation of di-DOPA, but failed to induce larger intermolecular aggregation phenomena. The described methodological combination of surface sensitive methods, like QCM-D, and bulk sensitive methods, like DLS and SAXS, generates high resolution results and is an attractive platform to investigate intra- and intermolecular aspects of assembly and cross-linking of the Mefp proteins.},

For coatings with a predominantly elastic response, characterized by relatively low phase angles, these quantities are the mass per unit area of the coating, the density-shear modulus product, and the phase angle itself. The approach was demonstrated with a model polyurethane coating, where the evolution of these properties as a function of cure time was investigated. For fully cured films, data obtained from the QCM are in good agreement with results obtained from traditional dynamic mechanical analysis.},

accurate determination of liquid sound velocities at kilohertz and
megahertz frequencies. Such plate - liquid - plate (PLP) resonators
offer a resolution , which is important for analytical work in
chemistry, bio- and physico-chemistry and for some technical
applications. A simple one-dimensional resonator model is derived

liquid and resonator parameters. This model obtains the peak shift by
variation of liquid velocity and density as well for plane wave
propagation; the effect from variations in has been neglected in most
ultrasonic studies so far. Caused by a frequency-dependent phase shift

	title = {Studies of contact mechanics with the {QCM}},
	volume = {5},
	abstract = {The quartz crystal microbalance can serve as high-frequency probe of the microcontacts formed between the crystal surface and a solid object touching it. On a simplistic level, the load can be approximated by an assembly of point masses, springs, and dashpots. The Sauerbrey model, leading to a decrease in frequency, is recovered if small particles are rigidly attached to the crystal. In another limiting case, the particles are so heavy that intertia holds them in place in the lab. frame. The spheres exert a restoring force onto the crystal, thereby increasing the stiffness of the composite resonator. The resonance frequency increases in proportion to the lateral spring const. of the sphere-plate contacts. A third limiting case is represented by particles attached to the crystal via a dashpot. Within this model (extensively used in nanotribol.) the dashpot increases the bandwidth. The momentum relaxation time tS ({\textbackslash}"slip time{\textbackslash}") is calcd. from the ratio of the increase in bandwidth and the decrease in frequency, DG/(-Df). The force-displacement relations in contact mechanics are often nonlinear. A prominent example is the transition from stick to slip. Even for nonlinear interactions, there is a strictly quant. relationship between the shifts of frequency and bandwidth, Df and DG, on the one hand, and the force acting on the crystal, F(t), on the other. Df and DG are proportional to the in-phase and the out-of-phase component of F(t), resp. Evidently, F(t) cannot be explicitly derived from Df and DG. Still, any contact-mech. model (like the Mindlin model of partial slip) can be tested by comparing the predicted and the measured values of Df and DG. Further exptl. constraints stem from the measurement of the amplitude dependence of the resonance parameters. Contacts mechanics in the MHz range is much different from its low-frequency counterpart. For instance, static friction coeffs. probed with MHz excitation are often much above 1. Contact mechanics at short time scales should be of substantial practical relevance. [on SciFinder (R)]},

The study on different harmonics allowed to evaluate the variation of the effective vibrating area of each crystal and the effect of energy trapping intrinsic to a crystal of finite surface was then emphasized. It was also shown that the impedance behaviour is affected by the piezoelectric stiffening and the boundary conditions of real quartz resonators. These perturbing effects have a significant magnitude on the fundamental harmonic mode, and to a lesser extent on the third and fifth overtones. Besides, the theoretical models established for viscoelastic analysis of coated layers are based on the assumption that the quartz crystals are ideal with an infinite surface.

Two regimes of film behavior can be distinguished:  the gravimetric regime, where the sensor response is mainly mass sensitive, and the nongravimetric regime, where viscoelasticity gains influence on the sensor response. We develop a method, which allows the assignment of the sensor signal to a gravimetric or a nongravimetric response. The critical value can be determined from oscillator measurements.

They are composed of piezoelectric crystal plus at least one layer of chemically interactive material (CIM) deposited on one of their surfaces in order to infer a given chemical sensitivity. Electronic noses based on quartz crystal microbalances (QCM) are widely used in volatile organic compounds analysis. These multisensor systems typically employ a number of quartzes coated with different CIM having broad and overlapping sensitivity. Depending on the number of sensors used and taking into account the electronic units needed to drive them, the total volume of such a system may be considerable. In the present work we have shown the possibility of including four different QCM in the same quartz plate in order to reduce the overall space dedicated to the sensors, realizing the so called multichannel quartz crystal microbalance (MQCM). Moreover we have investigated the possibility of using a single oscillator circuit to drive the oscillations for all the four channels of the MQCM. The work outlines the advantages of implementing this single oscillator technique in terms of volume reduction, better homogeneity in the sensor array behavior and power saving. The overall system comprising the sensor array, the driving oscillator and the electronic interface has been built and successfully tested.},

These frequency changes depended on the wavelength of the irradiated laser in the order of 523 nm {\textgreater} 636 nm {\textgreater} 785 nm, which corresponds to the light absorbance of the Au electrode of the QCM.  The laser response increased linearly with increasing laser power (5 - 60 mW).  In addition, the laser response showed a maximum at the incidence angle of 72 degrees when the P-polarized 636 nm laser was irradiated on the Au surface, due to the evanescent effect.  These laser responses were also observed in the humid air of H2O, D2O, and in the vapors of various alcohols.  Based on these findings, the observed frequency increase (mass decrease) can be explained by the photo-induced reversible desorption of water molecules from the Au electrode surface of the QCM due to the interfacial property changes.},

It is found that the sample{\^A}{\textquestiondown}s electrical capacitance (the ratio of surface potential and surface polarization at the crystal surface) enters the motional branch of the equivalent circuit, thereby shifting the series resonance frequency. This effect is caused by piezoelectric stiffening. Using a conventional quartz crystal with small hole in the front electrode and exposing this crystal to a variety of different liquids, we demonstrate that derived equation describes the experiment reasonably well. Electric and dielectric effects are particularly strong for torsional resonators, which operate at a frequency of around 56 kHz. These are in commercial use for determination of the viscosity of engine oils. We propose a simple method to in situ switch the strength of piezoelectric stiffening. It allows separation of the viscoelastic parameters from the electric polarizability. It could, for instance, be used to differentiate between gasoline and water being accidentally admitted to the lubricant reservoir.

This model is valid in the vicinity of film resonance, which occurs when the acoustic phase shift across the film is an odd multiple of $\pi$/2 rad. For low-loss films, this model accurately predicts the frequency changes and damping that arise at resonance and is a reasonable approximation away from resonance. Elements of the parallel LCR resonator are explicitly related to film properties and can be interpreted in terms of elastic energy storage and viscous power dissipation.

	volume = {92},
	abstract = {I. Introduction The QCM comprises a thin quartz crystal sandwiched between two metal electrodes that establishes an alternating electric field across the crystal, causing vibrational motion of the crystal at its resonant frequency. This resonant frequency is sensitive to mass changes ( and other factors) of the crystal and its electrodes. The ability to employ one side of the EQCM as a working electrode in an electrochemical cell while simultaneously measuring minute mass change has provide a powerful approach to examining electochemical processes involving thin films. These studies have revealed detailed mechanistic information about film deposition and dissolution, surface morphology changes, and mass changes in thin films caused by redox or other chemical processes. In the earliest time, the EQCM was used in ex situ experiments to measure mass changes at the electrode surface after electrodeposition of metals. Later, the experimental methods required for its use as an in situ mass sensor for the thin films. II. Basic principles of AT-cut Quartz Resonaztors QCM is not a mass sensor but is affected by other environmental effects that are always readily obvious in the sample configuration commonly employed by most investigators. A. The Piezoelectric effect The piezoelectric effect: a mechanical stress applied to the surfaces of various crystals afforded a corresponding electrical potential across the crystal whose magnitude was proportional to the applied stress. This property only exists in materials that are acentric; that is, those that crystallize in noncentrosymmetric space groups. If the stress is applied across an appropriate direction, the resulting atomic displacement will result in the corresponding change in the net dipole moment. This change will produce a net change in electrical charge on the faces of the crystal. Converse piezoelectric effect: application of a voltage across the crystals afforded a corresponding mechanical strain. AT-cut quartz resonator: which consists of a thin quartz wafer prepared by slicing through a quartz rod at an angle of approximately 35 degree with respect to the x axis. Application of an electric field across the crystal produces a shear strain proportional to the applied potential. In quartz this deformation is elastic. It follows that an alternating potential across the crystal causes a vibrational motion in the quartz crystal with amplitude parallel to the surface of the crystal. The result of the vibrational motion of the quartz crystal is the establishment of a transverse acoustic wave that propagates across the thickness of the crystal, reflecting back into the crystal at the surfaces. The quartz surface is at an antinode of the acoustic wave. Accordingly, when a uniform layer of a foreign material is added to the surface of the acoustic wave will travel across the interface between the quartz and the layer, and will propagate through the foreign layer. This implicitly assumes that particle displacement and shear stress are continuous across the interfaces.(no-slip condition) Sauerbrey equation: Dm: mass change Df: frequency shift f0: the parent frequency of the quartz crystal (9 MHz or 5) A: the electrode area(0.20cm2) mq: the shear modulus of the quartz (2.947*1011 dyn cm-2) rq: the density of quartz(2.648g/cm3) Increasing the quartz crystal thickness result in increase the wavelength and decrease the fundamental frequency, analogous to increasing the length of a string. The Sauerbery relationship require that the deposited film have a uniform thickness across the entire active region of the resonator. D. Nonideal or unexpected behavior in QCM investigations QCM measures frequency changes and not mass changes. 1.Viscoelastic effects: generally been ignored. 2.High mass loading: decrease sensitivity. Typically, QCM measurements are considered accurate provided the mass of the film does not exceed 2\% of the mass of the crystal. 3.Surface Roughness: The microscopic roughness of the QCM electrode surface can play an important role in the behavior of the QCM in liquid media. Trapping of liquid in surface cavitie4s will result in an additional mass component whose magnitude will depend upon the amount of trapped liquid and the size of the cavities. 80\% of the observed frequency shifts could be attributed to roughness effects. 4. Surface stress: QCM investigations are typically performed with one side of the AT-cut quartz crystal immersed under a column of liquid with the opposite side facing air. This arrangement will result in a stress on the quartz crystal due to the hydrostatic pressure exerted by the column of the liquid. The hydrostatic pressure of a 1-cm column of water in a typical QCM apparatus is approximately N3cm-2. 5. Interfacial Slippage: assume no-slip condition. Surface energy play an important role in determining the extent of slippage at the interface. 6.Nonuniform mass distribution: the physical behavior of quartz resonators is significantly different in gas and liquid media. The radial sensitivity of the QCM requires a uniform distribution if accurate measurements are to be made using the Sauerbrey equation. III. Experimental Aspects and relation of electrochemical parameters to EQCM Frequency changes operation of the potentiostat or galvanostat is accomplished by computer, which is interfaced directly to both the electrochemical intrumentation and the frequency measuring instrumentation(frequency counter, frequency to voltage converter). The computer simultaueously generates the electrochemical excitation wave form and measures the current passing through the EQCM working electrode as well as the frequency of oscillation of the quartz disk. Comparison of these data provides for a better understanding of interfacial processes coupled to the redox event. IV Investigation of thin films QCM with a fundamental frequency of 5 MHz has a sensitivity of 56.6 Hzcm2ug-1, and can be operated with a noise level {\textless} 1Hz. Under these conditions the minimum detectable mass change is approximately 10 ngcm-2. Interfacial processes can be measured on a time scale of approximately 100 ms. The ultimate time resolution of the QCM is fundamentally limited by the time required for equilibration of the device with the deposited mass. the quality factor of a 5-MHz in liquid media is typically 2000-30000. a. electrode position of metals b. dissolution of metal films c. electrovalency measurements of anion adsorption d. hydrogen absorption in metal films e. bubble formation f. other thin film systems: deposition of thin films of semiconductor materials, molecular charge transfer salts, nucleation and growth, dissolution mechanism, thin film catalytic systems g.

We report evidence for graphitic material in the tribological layer in metal-on-metal hip replacements retrieved from patients.

	volume = {31},
	abstract = {The evolution of linear viscoelasticity during cross-linking of a stoichiometrically imbalanced polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was measured by small amplitude oscillatory shear. At the gel point (GP), stress relaxation was found to follow a power law, St{\textendash}n, as described by the previously suggested gel equation. However, while stoichiometrically balanced gels (PDMS, polyurethanes) gave the specific exponent value of n=1/2, a higher exponent value, 1/2{\textless}1, was measured on a stoichiometrically imbalanced PDMS sample. Transformation of the data from the frequency to the time domain required the hypothesis that the power law behavior extends over the entire frequency range, 0{\textless}{\textless}. The imbalanced gel exhibited a higher loss than storage modulus, G(){\textgreater}G(), and a higher rate of stress relaxation. GP was found to occur before the crossover point of the loss and storage moduli, G(0,t), and G(0,t), as measured during the cross-linking reaction (reaction time, t) at constant frequency, 0. This suggests new methods for localizing GP, for instance by the detection of a loss tangent independent of the frequency. All the experiments were performed with end-linking networks far above the glass transition temperature. The network junctions were assumed to be due to chemical cross-links only and not due to any other association phenomenon such as crystallization or phase separation.},

Various models for the mechanical contact between the oscillating quartz crystal and the liquid are described, and theoretical predictions are compared with the experimental results. Special attention is paid to consideration of the influence of slippage and surface roughness on the QCM response at the solid{\textendash}liquid interface. The main question, which we would like to answer in this chapter, is what information on the structure and dynamics at the solid{\textendash}liquid interface can be extracted from the QCM measurements. In particular, we demonstrate that the quartz crystal resonator acts as a true microbalance only if, in the course of the process being studied, the nature of the interface (its roughness, slippage, the density and viscosity of the solution adjacent to it, and the structure of the solvent in contact with it) is maintained constant. So far most of the QCM data were analyzed on a qualitative level only. The next step in QCM studies requires a quantitative treatment of the experimental results. Theoretical basis for the solution of this problem already exists, and has been discussed in this review. Joint experimental and theoretical efforts to elevate the QCM technique to a new level present a challenge for future investigators.},

The growth of the multilayers has been followed using dissipative quartz crystal microbalance and ellipsometry. Neutron reflectometry and XPS data indicate that the PSS and PDADMAC layers interpenetrate leading to an almost homogeneous polymer film. The results show that on increasing [NaCl] the growing process changes from a linear to a non-linear regime. The comparison of the thickness values obtained from QCM and ellipsometry has allowed us to calculate the water content of the polymer film. The results agree with those obtained by neutron reflectometry. The analysis of the QCM data has provided values of the complex shear modulus, which are typical of a rubber-like polymer system. The analysis of the mass adsorbed calculated by the ellipsometry measurements indicated that the charge compensation mechanism changes from intrinsic at low ionic strengths to mainly extrinsic at high ionic strengths. Finally, it was found that the response of a polymer film to a change in [NaCl] is rather different for films grown at low or at high ionic strengths.},

It employs a long cylindrically shaped resonating element driven by an X-cut (torsional mode) quartzpiezoelectric crystal. Up to 11 different normal modes are employed, resulting in 11 discrete frequencies, ranging from approximately 20 to 500 kHz. Measurements are made in free decay; a key feature of the apparatus is the method for high precision measurements of damping coefficients and eigenfrequencies. The instrument is suitable for liquids with 0.003P\&lt;{\textbardbl}$\eta$*{\textbardbl}\&lt;5P and $\eta${\textquoteright}>=1.33$\eta${\textquoteleft}. Typically, $\eta${\textquoteright} has a relative uncertainty of {\textpm}2\% or less, with the relative uncertainty for $\eta${\textquoteleft} being about 4\% for liquids with $\eta${\textquoteleft} greater than 0.01P. Values of $\eta${\textquoteright} obtained in the HFTRA for low viscosity liquids with small $\eta${\textquoteleft} show excellent agreement with the known steady flow viscosities.Measurements of the viscoelasticproperties of polymer solutions employing the HFTRA and two other instruments capable of higher precision measurements show excellent agreement, demonstrating that the HFTRA is sufficiently precise for dilute-solution viscoelasticity studies; the working frequency range is such that most of the polymerrelaxation time spectrum can be probed for many polymer/solvent combinations.},

Evidence of the viscoelastic nature of the films was observed for films thicker than 90 nm through the frequency and energy dissipation changes. For sufficiently thin films (t {\textless} 40 nm), the frequency change could be effectively modeled as a simple increase in mass, as predicted by the Sauerbrey equation. The viscosity of the swollen films was independent of initial polymer film thickness (93?205 nm). The equilibrium swelling ratio was independent of film thickness for all films examined (3?205 nm). The transition between the observation of a rigid film and a film showing viscoelastic character was found to be at ?1D = 0.26 {\textpm} 0.10, where ?1 = 2$\pi$/?s, ?s is the shear wavelength, and D is the film thickness.

	abstract = {Closed-form asymptotic expressions for the frequency{\textendash}wavenumber dispersion relations in doubly rotated quartz plates vibrating in the vicinity of the odd pure thickness frequencies are derived from the equations of linear piezoelectricity and the associated boundary conditions on the major surfaces. The usual assumptions of small piezoelectric coupling and small wavenumbers along the plate are made and it is supposed that the pure thickness frequencies are sufficiently different that one pure thickness wave is dominant at a time. In the treatment the mechanical displacement is decomposed along the eigenvector triad of the pure thickness solution to facilitate the asymptotic analysis. The fact that the wavenumbers along the plate are restricted to be small significantly reduces the complexity of the equations without neglecting any transformed elastic constants. The resulting asymptotic dispersion equation enables the construction of a scalar differential equation describing the transverse behavior of essentially thickness modes of vibration in doubly rotated quartz plates. The scalar equation is applied in the analysis of both trapped energy resonators with rectangular electrodes and contoured crystal resonators using established procedures. In particular, calculations performed for the contoured SC cut and a number of other doubly rotated orientations are shown to be in excellent agreement with experiment. Since the differential equation for each harmonic family depends on the order of the harmonic and in the general doubly rotated case contains mixed derivatives in the plane of the plate, a different transformation is required for each harmonic family to obtain the coordinate system in which the mixed derivatives do not appear and, hence, the equation is separable. An interesting consequence of this transformation is that since the nodal planes of the anharmonics of each harmonic family of the contoured SC-cut quartz resonator are oriented along the transformed coordinate system for that harmonic family, they are oriented differently for each harmonic family.},

In addition, complementary efforts to improve the sensing films have been done during these years. All these developments have been made with the aim of achieving, in a future, a highly sensitive, low cost, small size, multi-channel, portable, reliable and commercially established SGAW biosensor. A setup with these features could significantly contribute to future developments in the health, food and environmental industries. The second purpose of this work is to describe the state-of-the-art of SGAW biosensors for the detection of pathogens, being this topic an issue of extremely importance for the human health.

The resonance frequency allows an absolute measurement of the viscosity but leads to an accuracy limited to 5\% whereas the bandwidth technique which works in a relative way provides an accuracy of 2\%. The techniques were tested by carrying out measurements in two pure compounds: heptane and toluene. Measurement results demonstrate the feasibility of the technique in this viscosity range. The apparatus was also used to determine the viscosity of n-decane with dissolved methane.

	abstract = {A new approach to the electronic instrumentation for extracting data from resonator-based sensing devices (e.g., microelectromechanical, piezoelectric, electrochemical, and acoustic) is suggested and demonstrated here. Traditionally, oscillator-based circuitry is employed to monitor shift in the resonance frequency of the resonator. These circuits give a single point measurement at the frequency where the oscillation criterion is met. However, the resonator response itself is broadband and contains much more information than a single point measurement. Here, we present a method for the broadband characterization of a resonator using white noise as an excitation signal. The resonator is used in a two-port filter configuration, and the resonator output is subjected to frequency spectrum analysis. The result is a wideband spectral map analogous to the magnitude of the S21 parameters of a conventional filter. Compared to other sources for broadband excitation (e.g., frequency chirp, multisine, or narrow time domain pulse), the white noise source requires no design of the input signal and is readily available for very wide bandwidths (1 MHz-3 GHz). Moreover, it offers simplicity in circuit design as it does not require precise impedance matching; whereas such requirements are very strict for oscillator-based circuit systems, and can be difficult to fulfill. This results in a measurement system that does not require calibration, which is a significant advantage over oscillator circuits. Simulation results are first presented for verification of the proposed system, followed by measurement results with a prototype implementation. A 434 MHz surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonator and a 5 MHz quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) are measured using the proposed method, and the results are compared to measurements taken by a conventional bench-top network analyzer. Maximum relative differences in the measured resonance frequencies of the SAW and QCM resonators are 0.0004\% and 0.002\%, respectively. The ability to track a changing sensor response is demonstrated by inducing temperature variations and measuring resonance frequency simultaneously using the proposed technique in parallel with a network analyzer. The relative difference between the two measurements is about 5.53 ppm, highlighting the impressive accuracy of the proposed system. Using commercially available digital signal processors (DSPs), we believe that this technique can be implemented as a system-on-a-chip solution resulting in a very low cost, easy to use, portable, and customizable sensing system. In addition, given the simplicity of the signal and circuit design, and its immunity to other common interface concerns (injection locking, oscillator interference, and drift, etc.), this method is better suited to accommodating array-based systems.},

	abstract = {This paper summarizes the results of the process optimization for SU-8 films with thicknesses <=5 {\textmu}m. The influence of soft-bake conditions, exposure dose and post-exposure-bake parameters on residual film stress, structural stability and lithographic resolution was investigated. Conventionally, the SU-8 is soft-baked after spin coating to remove the solvent. After the exposure, a post-exposure bake at a high temperature TPEB >= 90 {\textdegree}C is required to cross-link the resist. However, for thin SU-8 films this often results in cracking or delamination due to residual film stress. The approach of the process optimization is to keep a considerable amount of the solvent in the SU-8 before exposure to facilitate photo-acid diffusion and to increase the mobility of the monomers. The experiments demonstrate that a replacement of the soft-bake by a short solvent evaporation time at ambient temperature allows cross-linking of the thin SU-8 films even at a low TPEB = 50 {\textdegree}C. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy is used to confirm the increased cross-linking density. The low thermal stress due to the reduced TPEB and the improved structural stability result in crack-free structures and solve the issue of delamination. The knowledge of the influence of different processing parameters on the responses allows the design of optimized processes for thin SU-8 films depending on the specific application.},

The out-of-plane Poisson's ratio ($\nu$2) was obtained by high pressure gas dilatometry measurements. The bulk compressibility ($\kappa$) and the volumetric TEC ($\alpha$ v ) of the material were measured by a pressure-volume-temperature (PVT) apparatus. Finally, the out-of-plane properties, including the out-of-plane TEC ($\alpha$2) and the out-of-plane Young's modulus (E 2), were calculated from the measured in-plane properties and the volumetric properties.

An interfacial slip phenomenon is expected to occur at the interface between the surface of a quartz crystal sensor and the contacted liquid environment. Assumptions of continuous displacement and stress at the liquid{\textendash}solid interface mask the physical details of the contact interface. In this paper, the motion equations of the interfacial particles are employed to replace the interfacial continuous displacement and continuous stress assumptions. The electrical impedance of QCM in the liquid environment is derived based on this proposed modeling. The comparison of the present result with that of the continuous stress and displacement model is presented. The slip parameter, which is defined as the amount of displacement transmission between the quartz crystal top surface and bottom liquid particles, is presented as a function of the contact properties. The effects of interactive force strength, liquid viscosity and attached-particles size are included in the numerical studies. The detailed modeling of the interface is useful in interpreting the slip phenomenon between the sensor surface and the liquid.},

Photon Cross Correlation Spectroscopy (PCCS) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis performed on the liquid and cured epoxy{\textendash}silica nanocomposites indicate a nearly homogeneous distribution of the nanoscaled silica in the epoxy matrix, even at rather high weight percentages. Depending on the silica content of the composite, its stiffness, strength and toughness can be increased significantly compared with neat resin. Moreover, resin shrinkage and the thermal expansion (CTE) can be significantly reduced and the thermal conductivity increased. Concomitant the glass transition temperature remains nearly constant. The initial viscosity of the resin increases slightly depending on the nanoparticle content, while the gel-time slightly decreases. The injectability of the nanocomposite for the purpose of lamination using the LCM technology is nearly unaffected. The optimum filler content is at approx. 25 wt\% silica.

The decay is measured using a ferrite toroid transformer. One of the crystal leads is fed through the center of the ferrite toroid and thereby acts as the primary winding of the transformer. The secondary winding of the transformer is connected to a digitizing oscilloscope which records the decay of the crystal oscillation. From the recorded decay curve, the absolute dissipation factor (calculated from the decay time constant) and the series resonant frequency of the freely oscillating crystal are obtained. Alternatively, the dissipation factor and resonant frequency can be measured for the crystal oscillating under open-circuit conditions, i.e., in the parallel mode. The measurements are automated.},

In each of these applications, an advantage of QCM-based rheology is described, such as small sample size, precision and the ability to perform either bulk or surface measurements.

	abstract = {AT-cut quartz crystals have been driven with the so-called lateral field excitation. When applying a voltage to the two electrodes placed on one crystal surface and separated by a small gap an electric field is generated, which is mainly confined in the lateral direction. Extraordinary changes can be observed in the conductance spectrum when applying a liquid to the other (bare) surface of the crystal. In contrast to traditional quartz crystal sensors, these changes must be attributed to electrical properties of the adjacent medium. It is suggested that a redistribution of the exciting electric field from the lateral toward the thickness direction occurs. The assumption is supported by simulations which allow insights into the piezoelectric excitation and transduction mechanism of the acoustic device under varied electrical boundary conditions at the bare surface as well as the shear displacement patterns involved. Results from 10 MHz plano{\textendash}plano and 6 MHz plano{\textendash}convex sensors which have been exposed to liquids of varying permittivity show the strong dependence of the sensor response on liquid permittivity which overlies the known dependence on density{\textendash}viscosity.},

Even at a coverage below 50\%, the protein layer exhibits Sauerbrey-like behavior, meaning that the magnitude in the frequency shift {\textbar}?f{\textbar} much exceeds the shift in bandwidth and that the normalized frequency shift, ?f/n (n the overtone order), is similar on the different overtones. The relation between coverage and frequency shift was found to be nonlinear. In order to model this situation, we performed finite element method calculations based on the incompressible Navier?Stokes equation. The comparison between the model and the experiment suggests that the deformation of the protein upon adsorption is small. For low coverage, the volume of the trapped solvent exceeds the volume of the adsorbate itself. The ratio of the two decreases with increasing coverage. This is the cause of the experimentally observed nonlinear relationship between the surface coverage and frequency shift. Comparing frequency shifts at different overtones, one finds that ?f/n slightly decreases with overtone order. Such a behavior is typically attributed to softness. The model shows that, for the adsorbed spheres, this apparent softness arises through a rocking motion of the spheres at the surface instead of the shear deformation. Also, there is a hydrodynamic contribution (related to roughness) to the overtone dependence of ?f/n.},

The technique is a noncontact technique that can be used to quantify the temperature or time-dependent viscoelastic response in homogeneous films with thicknesses in the micrometer range. This work complements the ability of the resonators to quantify the viscoelastic behavior of viscoelastic polymer solutions and simple Newtonian liquids. For each material we obtain the density?shear modulus product and the viscoelastic phase angle at frequencies of 5 and 15 MHz. A standardized analysis protocol is described that enables this information to be obtained reliably and accurately. The polyisoprene data are found to be in good agreement with measurements obtained by dynamic mechanical analysis using extrapolated temperature shift factors.},

One of the fundamental means of making these measurements is the so-called impedance (or admittance) spectra method. The resonant properties of the piezoelectric QCM sensor are measured over a spectral range in the neighborhood of a resonance, both with load and without load. The changes in the spectrum upon loading can be compared to models that describe the changes based on the mass density, the shear modulus, and the viscosity of the load. This comparison can be made with confidence so long as the spectrum corresponds to the model assumption of a single main resonance. Often, there exists a spurious resonance lying above the main resonance which is not included in the models. This can change the shape of the spectrum in ways not included in the model analysis. We describe a method we have used that separates the spur resonance from the main resonance, permitting the parameters of the main resonance to be isolated from that of the spur. These corrected parameters of the main resonance can then be used with confidence in model analyses.},

A cell was specially designed to allow DWS investigations of dense colloids under the condition of shear, in both continuous and oscillatory modes. We demonstrate here the results of the rheo-optical approach to the diagnostics of the condition of an AMG, produced by the addition of glucono-$\delta$-lactone to skimmed milk, under shear.

We first consider a simple Kelvin body and then generalize the results to media with arbitrary linear rheology. The resulting frictional force as a function of velocity shows the same qualitative behavior as in the case of planar surfaces: it increases monotonically before reaching a plateau. However, the dependencies on normal force, sliding velocity, shear modulus, viscosity, rms roughness, rms surface gradient and the Hurst exponent are different for different macroscopic shapes. We suggest analytical relations describing the coefficient of friction in a wide range of loading conditions and suggest a master curve procedure for the dependence on the normal force.

An electric relaxation is observed at several hundreds of megahertz in a PC solution of LiClO4 at a concentration higher than 0.5 mol dm?3. The amplitude and frequency of the relaxation become larger and lower, respectively, with an increase in the concentration of salt. With the addition of such less-polar cosolvents as dimethyl carbonate, 1,4-dioxane or benzene at fixed concentrations (0.5, 2.0, and 3.0 mol dm?3) of the salt, decreases in the amplitude and relaxation time are observed.

Presented is the necessary theory (Johannsmann and Voinova models) to perform such measurements, and some applications of that theory - including rheology on polymer brush layers, lipid vesicle adsorption, proteins in the bulk phase, and microemulsions. In each of these applications, an advantage of QCM-based rheology is described, such as small sample size, precision and the ability to perform either bulk or surface measurements. Additionally, corrections to the standard Sauerbrey approximation, which often results in an underestimation of adsorbed mass, are presented.

	abstract = {Proteins are complex macromolecules with dynamic conformations. They are charged like colloids, but unlike colloids, charge is~heterogeneously distributed on their surfaces. Here we overturn entrenched doctrine that uncritically treats bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a colloidal hard sphere by elucidating the complex pH and surface hydration-dependence of solution viscosity. We measure the infinite shear viscosity of buffered BSA solutions in a parameter space chosen to tune competing long-range repulsions and short-range attractions (2~mg/mL <= [BSA] <= 500~mg/mL and 3.0~<= pH <= 7.4). We account for surface hydration through partial specific volume to define volume fraction and determine that the pH-dependent BSA intrinsic viscosity never equals the classical hard sphere result (2.5). We attempt to fit our data to the colloidal rheology models of Russel, Saville, and Schowalter (RSS) and Krieger-Dougherty (KD), which are each routinely and successfully applied to uniformly charged suspensions and to hard-sphere suspensions, respectively. We discover that the RSS model accurately describes our data at pH 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0, but fails at pH 6.0 and 7.4, due to steeply rising solution viscosity at high concentration. When we implement the KD model with the maximum packing volume fraction as the sole floating parameter while holding the intrinsic viscosity constant, we conclude that the model only succeeds at pH 6.0 and 7.4. These findings lead us to define a minimal framework for models of crowded protein solution viscosity wherein critical protein-specific attributes (namely, conformation, surface hydration, and surface charge distribution) are addressed.},

	abstract = {We study the short-time relaxation dynamics of crosslinked and uncrosslinked networks of semi-flexible polymers using diffusing wave spectroscopy (DWS). The networks consist of concentrated solutions of actin filaments, crosslinked with increasing amounts of $\alpha$-actinin. Actin filaments (F-actin) are long semi-flexible polymers with a contour length 1{\textendash}100$\mu$m and a persistence length of 5{\textendash}15$\mu$m; $\alpha$-actinin is a small 200kDa homodimer with two actin-binding sites. Using the large bandwidth of DWS, we measure the mean-square-displacement of 0.96$\mu$m diameter microspheres imbedded in the polymer network, from which we extract the frequency-dependent viscoelastic moduli via a generalized Langevin equation. DWS measurements yield, in a single measurement, viscoelastic moduli at frequencies up to 105Hz, almost three decades higher in frequency than probed by conventional mechanical rheology. Our measurements show that the magnitude of the small-frequency plateau modulus of F-actin is greatly enhanced in the presence of $\alpha$-actinin, and that the frequency dependence of the viscoelastic moduli is much stronger at intermediate frequencies. However, the frequency-dependence of loss and storage moduli become similar for both crosslinked and uncrosslinked networks at large frequencies, G'($\omega$)?G''($\omega$)?$\omega$0.75{\textpm}0.08. This high-frequency behavior is due to the small-amplitude, large-frequency lateral fluctuations of actin filaments between entanglements.},

	abstract = {A novel technique, based on low intensity ultrasonic wave propagation, has been applied to investigate the gelation of a waxy crude oil, caused by the crystallization of paraffin fractions as the temperature reduces below a threshold value, called WAT (wax appearance temperature). Because this phenomenon significantly affects the rheological behavior of crude oils, the knowledge of the conditions under which it occurs, during oil storage and/or transportation, is a topical issue in the oil industry. In this work, an ultrasonic equipment has been set up, able to propagate longitudinal waves in the MHz range and to display in real time the behavior of ultrasonic velocity and attenuation when the crude oil sample is subjected to heating and cooling cycles. When the ultrasonic probes alternatively rotate as parallel plates of a conventional rheometer, low intensity longitudinal waves (in the megahertz range), and shear oscillations (in the hertz range) are simultaneously applied on the sample, thus widely broadening the frequency range of investigation. On cooling, the crystallization of paraffin fractions and the consequent formation of a network structure in the oil matrix are responsible of the development and growth of the crude oil elastic response, which becomes dominant over the viscous response. This process can be reliably detected by dynamic mechanical analysis and by ultrasonic analysis through the increase of the storage modulus G' and longitudinal velocity, respectively. The growth and further association between wax crystals causes a dissipation of acoustic energy, which is indicated by the increase of the wave attenuation. The combination of rheological and ultrasonic methods has provided a better insight both on the gel transition of crude oils and the viscoelastic behavior of gelled samples. The ultrasonic wave propagation has demonstrated to be a powerful tool for monitoring the sol{\textendash}gel transition in waxy crude oils. Finally, the effect of ultrasonic waves with different intensity on the gel build-up has been also evaluated. A reduction of the gel strength with increasing wave intensity has been observed and the recovery of elastic response after removing ultrasonic irradiation has been monitored.},

The work was aimed at establishing the viability of the technique for analyzing protein solution rheology as well as obtaining an initial understanding of the effect of solution conditions on solution rheology of a model protein. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used for this study, and rheological analysis was conducted at 20 $\mu$L sample volume between pH 2.0 and 9.0 at different ionic strengths at 25{\textdegree}C using 5 and 10 MHz quartz crystals. Significant differences in storage modulus among solutions at pH 5.0, 7.0, and 9.0 could only be detected at 10 MHz, and the errors associated with measurements were smaller as compared to those at 5 MHz for all the solutions studied. Solutions at pH 2.0 and 3.0 showed a time-dependent change in solution rheology. For solutions at pH 5.0, 7.0, and 9.0, which did not show time dependence in solution rheology, loss modulus data at lower concentrations correlated well with the dilute solution data in the literature. At higher concentrations, pH 5.0 solutions exhibited a higher loss modulus than pH 7.0 and pH 9.0 solutions. Storage modulus decreased with increasing ionic strength, unlike loss modulus, which did not show any change, except at pI of protein when no effect was observed. The results show the potential of high frequency rheometry for analyzing subtle differences in rheology of pharmaceutically relevant protein solutions at microliter volume. {\textcopyright} 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association J Pharm Sci 94:1161{\textendash}1168, 2005},

	abstract = {The processes of adhesion, spreading and proliferation of human mammary cancer cells MCF-7 on two Au electrodes with different surface roughness (Rf and Rf = 3.2 or 1.1) were monitored and clearly identified with the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) technique. Analyses of the QCM responses on the resonant frequency shifts ($\Delta$f0) vs. the motional resistance changes ($\Delta$R1) revealed a significant surface-stress effect in the involved courses, in addition to a viscodensity effect and a relatively small mass effect (especially at the smooth electrode). Experiments of fluorescence microscopy, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were conducted to investigate the cell population on the electrode vs. the electrode-surface roughness. Simplified equations are deduced to quantitatively evaluate the surface stress, and a novel QCM method for dynamically measuring the surface stress on an electrode in cell-culture course is thus described. It was found that the smoother surface (Rf = 1.1) gave a higher surface stress during cell attachment and less cell population on it than the rougher surface (Rf = 3.2). In addition, real-time QCM monitoring showed on the same electrode the surface stress induced by hepatic normal cells being notably higher than that caused by hepatic cancer cells at cell-attachment stage, suggesting that the surface-stress measurement can exhibit the difference of adhesion-performance between the healthy and ill-behaved cells.},

For all thin films measured, the LCST was shown to slightly increase ({\textgreater}3 {\textdegree}C) in comparison to that of the bulk sample. However for these films, the increase in LCST was statistically identical, irrespective of thickness. Surprisingly, the volumetric swelling of the hydrogel in thin films, even at temperatures less than the LCST, was similar (within 20\%) to the volumetric swelling of the bulk hydrogel, despite the expected significant decrease associated with the hydrogel being constrained by the substrate as predicted by one dimensional Flory{\textendash}Rehner theory. We attribute this enhancement in swelling compared to theoretical expectations to the ability of the hydrophobic crosslinks to re-arrange under stress, which provides a mechanism to alleviate the decreased dimensionality imposed by the substrate; this mechanism is consistent with a large hysteresis in the swelling when cycling between 35 {\textdegree}C and 5 {\textdegree}C. Unlike the LCST, the swelling ratio increases with decreasing film thickness. At low temperatures (below the LCST), the volume swelling ratio increased from 3.9 to 4.9, while at temperatures above the LCST the swelling ratio increased from 1.5 to 2.5 when the film thickness decreased from 121 nm to 10 nm. The combination of facile processing through solution casting without the need for additional crosslinking chemistry and limited thickness dependent variation of swelling and LCST behavior in these physically crosslinked hydrogels makes these materials attractive for applications requiring thermoresponsive soft coatings.},

Gelation is reversible and can also be controlled with the electrochemical potential at the electrode. Further, a method was developed to characterize the viscoelastic properties of thin films in liquid media using the QCM as a high-frequency rheometer. By measuring the frequency and dissipation at multiple harmonics of the resonance frequency, the viscoelastic phase angle, density?modulus product, and areal mass of a film can be determined. The method was applied to characterize the protein films, demonstrating that they have a phase angle near 55{\textdegree} and a density-modulus product of ?107 Pa{\textperiodcentered}g/cm3.

	abstract = {Biosensors, in which binding of ligands is detected through changes in the optical or electrochemical properties of a DNA layer confined to the sensor surface, are important tools for investigating DNA interactions. Here, we investigate if conformational changes induced in surface-attached DNA molecules upon ligand binding can be monitored by the quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) technique. DNA duplexes containing 59?184 base pairs were formed on QCM-D crystals by stepwise assembly of synthetic oligonucleotides of designed base sequences. The DNA films were exposed to the cationic polyamines spermidine and spermine, known to condense DNA molecules in bulk experiments, or to the recombination protein Rad51, known to extend the DNA helix. The binding and dissociation of the ligands to the DNA films were monitored in real time by measurements of the shifts in resonance frequency (?f) and in dissipation (?D). The QCM-D data were analyzed using a Voigt-based model for the viscoelastic properties of polymer films in order to evaluate how the ligands affect thickness and shear viscosity of the DNA layer. Binding of spermine shrinks all DNA layers and increases their viscosity in a reversible fashion, and so does spermidine, but to a smaller extent, in agreement with its lower positive charge. SPR was used to measure the amount of bound polyamines, and when combined with QCM-D, the data indicate that the layer condensation leads to a small release of water from the highly hydrated DNA films. The binding of Rad51 increases the effective layer thickness of a 59bp film, more than expected from the know 50\% DNA helix extension. The combined results provide guidelines for a QCM-D biosensor based on ligand-induced structural changes in DNA films. The QCM-D approach provides high discrimination between ligands affecting the thickness and the structural properties of the DNA layer differently. The reversibility of the film deformation allows comparative studies of two or more analytes using the same DNA layer as demonstrated here by spermine and spermidine.},

	abstract = {The sequential hybridization of a 534 base pair DNA concatemer layer was monitored by QCM-D and SPR, and the QCM-D data were analyzed by Voigt viscoelastic models. The results show that Voigt-based modeling gives a good description of the experimental data but only if shear viscosity and elasticity are allowed to depend on the shear frequency. The derived layer thickness, shear viscosity and elasticity of the growing film give a representation of the DNA film in agreement with known bulk properties of DNA, and reveal a maximum in film viscosity when the molecules in the layer contain 75 base pairs. The experimental data during construction of a 3084 bp DNA concatemer layer were compared to predictions of the QCM-D response of a 1 ?m thick film of rod-like polymers. A predicted nonmonotonous variation of dissipation with frequency (added mass) is in qualitative agreement with the experiments, but with a quantitative disagreement which likely reflects that the flexibility of such long DNA molecules is not included in the model.},

	abstract = {We show how the water content (and effective density) of thin adsorbed films composed of biomolecules can be determined using combined quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis. In particular, these techniques, combined with theoretical treatment using a Voigt-based viscoelastic model, were applied to analyze the state of surface immobilized single stranded biotin-modified probe DNA (b-DNA) coupled via streptavidin to a biotin-doped supported phospholipid bilayer (b-SPB)). From a proper analysis, it is demonstrated how changes in effective thickness, $\delta$f, and the viscoelastic components (shear viscosity, ?f, and shear elasticity, ?f)) can be obtained during both DNA immobilization and hybridization with single stranded fully complementary target DNA. In particular, it is demonstrated how this type of analysis can be used to control the state of streptavidin arrangement for improved measurements of DNA hybridization kinetics. The latter is demonstrated by identifying a surface-coverage dependent viscoelastic behavior of immobilized b-DNA, which is shown to influence the hybridization efficiency.},

This solution technique utilizes finite element analysis as an initial step to calculate mechanical stress distributions in quartz resonators. Output from the finite element solution is used in a recently developed program to calculate resonator frequency shifts as the final step. Frequency shifts are calculated via numerical integration of the perturbation integral derived by Tiersten.36 The solution technique is general in that any combination of mount and resonator geometries may be modelled. Any crystallographic orientation may be chosen and any load or combination of loads may be applied to the resonator. The frequency perturbation calculation includes movement of the mode to any position in the general vicinity of the resonator centre. Experimental results for AT- and SC-cut quartz resonators subjected to diametric forces and inertial loading verify the accuracy of frequency shifts calculated using the new solution technique.},

The objective was to develop a sensor with an operating pressure range of 0-103.42 MPa (0.15 000 lb/in/sup 2/), a temperature range of -10 to +175 degrees C, a pressure calibration accuracy of 6894.8 Pa (1 lb/in/sup 2/), and resolution of 68.95 Pa (0.01 lb/in/sup 2/) with 1-s counter gate time. Doubly rotated cuts with piezoelectric coupling to both the C-modes of vibration were investigated. A theoretical study and general design considerations in the development of such sensors are described. Experimental results were obtained for two sensor designs: one uses a cylindrical design with the SBTC-cut, and the other, called SPA, is a special resonator design vibrating around 5 MHz without any activity dips. Pressure sensitivity of approximately 145 Hz/MPa (1 Hz/lb/in/sup 2/) at 175 degrees C is obtained. Laboratory evaluation of the static and dynamic performances is discussed for the prototypes based on the SPA design.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

The vibration area is reduced in the fabrication of the high frequency QCM with an inverted mesa structure. To reduce the complexity of the side wall profile that results from anisotropic quartz etching, a rectangular vibration area is used instead of the conventional circular structure. QCMs with high Q values exceeding 25,000 at 47 MHz, 27,000 at  60 MHz, 24,000 at 73 MHz and 25,000 at 84 MHz are fabricated on 4 {\texttimes} 4  mm2 chips with small vibration areas of 1.2 {\texttimes} 1.4 mm2. A PMMA-based flow cell is designed and manufactured to characterize the behavior of the fabricated QCM chip in a liquid. Q values as high as 1,006 at 47 MHz, 904 at 62 MHz, 867 at 71 MHz and 747 at 84 MHz are obtained when one side of the chip is exposed to pure water.

Devices with up to 7.3 $\mu$m thick SiO2 guiding layers have been successully manufactured via an r.f. sputtering technique. Mass sensitivity, velocity, insertion loss, oscillation frequency stability and temperature coefficient of the frequency have been studied as a function of layer thickness. The sensitivity increases with increasing layer thickness and reaches a maximum at around 5.5 $\mu$m, for a wavelenght of 40 $\mu$m, in accordance with theory. Further increasing the thickness decreases the sensitivity dramatically. High sensitivity (>= 300 cm2 g-1) can be achieved at thickness between 3.5 and 6.5 $\mu$m. The Low-wave dual-channel delay-line oscilltors also demonstrate high frequency stability and low noise levels. The frequencies of the two channels track each other extremely well.},

The generalized Young-Laplace equation is presented for a planar interface and the propagation behavior of Love wave in a nanocoating is discussed. Parametric studies indicate that if the surface effect of the nanocoating is considered the phase velocity of Love wave shows notable size-dependency on both the nanocoating thickness and the wavelength. When these two sizes are both in nanoscale, the phase velocity further depends on the relative size between them. In addition, increasing the residual surface stress may reduce the phase velocity of Love wave.},

	abstract = {This review presents an overview of 20 years of worldwide development in the field of biosensors based on special types of surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices that permit the highly sensitive detection of biorelevant molecules in liquid media (such as water or aqueous buffer solutions). 1987 saw the first approaches, which used either horizontally polarized shear waves (HPSW) in a delay line configuration on lithium tantalate (LiTaO3) substrates or SAW resonator structures on quartz or LiTaO3 with periodic mass gratings. The latter are termed {\textquotedblleft}surface transverse waves{\textquotedblright} (STW), and they have comparatively low attenuation values when operated in liquids. Later Love wave devices were developed, which used a film resonance effect to significantly reduce attenuation. All of these sensor approaches were accompanied by the development of appropriate sensing films. First attempts used simple layers of adsorbed antibodies. Later approaches used various types of covalently bound layers, for example those utilizing intermediate hydrogel layers. Recent approaches involve SAW biosensor devices inserted into compact systems with integrated fluidics for sample handling. To achieve this, the SAW biosensors can be embedded into micromachined polymer housings. Combining these two features will extend the system to create versatile biosensor arrays for generic lab use or for diagnostic purposes. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]},

Online testing of industrial polymer films during preparation and conditioning is required to minimize material and energy consumption, improve the product quality, increase the production rate, and reduce the number of product rejects. It is well-known that shear horizontal surface acoustic wave (SH-SAW) propagation is sensitive to mass changes as well as to the mechanical properties of attached materials. In this work, the SH-SAW was used to monitor polymer property changes primarily dictated by variations in the viscoelasticity. The viscoelastic properties of a negative photoresist film were monitored throughout the ultraviolet (UV) light-induced polymer cross-linking process using SH-SAW delay line devices. Changes in the polymer film mass and viscoelasticity caused by UV exposure produced variations in the phase velocity and attenuation of the SH-SAW propagating in the structure. Based on measured polymer-coated delay line scattering transmission responses (S21) and the measured polymer layer thickness and density, the viscoelastic constants c44 and ?44 were extracted. The polymer thickness was found to decrease 0.6\% during UV curing, while variations in the polymer density were determined to be insignificant. Changes of 6\% in c44 and 22\% in ?44 during the cross-linking process were observed, showing the sensitivity of the SH-SAW phase velocity and attenuation to changes in the polymer film viscoelasticity. These results indicate the potential for SH-SAW devices as online monitoring sensors for polymer film processing.},

	abstract = {Fast ion adsorption processes in supercapacitors enable quick storage/delivery of significant amounts of energy, while ion intercalation in battery materials leads to even larger amounts of energy stored, but at substantially lower rates due to diffusional limitations. Intercalation of ions into the recently discovered 2D Ti3C2Tx (MXene) occurs with a very high rate and leads to high capacitance, posing a paradox. Herein, by characterizing the mechanical deformations of MXene electrode materials at various states-of-charge with a variety of cations (Li, Na, K, Cs, Mg, Ca, Ba, and three tetra-alkylammonium cations) during cycling by electrochemical quartz-crystal admittance (EQCA, quartz-crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring) combined with in situ electronic conductance and electrochemical impedance, light is shone on this paradox. Based on this work, it appears that the capacitive paradox stems from cationic insertion, accompanied by significant deformation of the MXene particles, that occurs so rapidly so as to resemble 2D ion adsorption at solid-liquid interfaces. The latter is greatly facilitated by the presence of water molecules between the MXene sheets.},

This frequency is commonly used to keep track of time (as in quartz wristwatches), to provide a stable clock signal for digital integrated circuits, and to stabilize frequencies for radio transmitters and receivers. The most common type of piezoelectric resonator used is the quartz crystal, so oscillator circuits incorporating them became known as crystal oscillators, but other piezoelectric materials including polycrystalline ceramics are used in similar circuits.
Quartz crystals are manufactured for frequencies from a few tens of kilohertz to hundreds of megahertz. More than two billion crystals are manufactured annually. Most are used for consumer devices such as wristwatches, clocks, radios, computers, and cellphones. Quartz crystals are also found inside test and measurement equipment, such as counters, signal generators, and oscilloscopes.},

In this research, Polymethyl Methacrylate (PMMA) micropillars are fabricated on a QCM substrate using nanoimprinting lithography. The effects of pillar geometry and physical properties, tuned by molecular weight (MW) of PMMA, on the resonant characteristics of QCM-micropillars device are systematically investigated. It is found that the resonant frequency shift increases with increasing MW. The coupled QCM-micropillars device displays nonlinear frequency response, which is opposite to the linear response of conventional QCM devices. In addition, a positive resonant frequency shift is captured near the resonant point of the coupled QCM-micropillars system. Humidity detection experiments show that compared to current nanoscale feature based QCM sensors, QCM-micropillars devices offer higher sensitivity and moderate response time. This research points to a novel way of improving sensitivity of acoustic wave sensors without the need for fabricating surface nanostructures.},

	abstract = {Dropletquartz crystal microbalance has been demonstrated to be a promising tool for accessing material properties of fluids as well as the diverse solid-fluid interface phenomena. However, a microliter droplet localized on the surface of the electrodes of finite lateral size may cause a nonuniform distribution of the plane velocity, which may lead to surface normal fluid flow and generate the compressional waves above the crystal surface. In the present article, we report systematical investigation on both resonance frequency and dissipation measurements with reference to the small droplets of silicone oils spreading on the surface of the quartz crystal microbalance. Significant cyclical variations in the resonant frequency and resistance of the crystal have been observed as the characteristic sizes of the silicone oil droplets are close to specific values known to favor compressional wave generation. The experimental results have been compared with the theoretical values predicted by the finite element computation associated with a simple hydrodynamic model. Good agreement between theory and experiment has been obtained. The finding indicates that the small droplets on the crystal surface can act as resonant cavities for the compressional wave generation and that the greatest propensity to exhibit periodical resonance behavior in the frequency and dissipation measurements is at droplet height of $\lambda$ c / 2 above the crystal surface.},

The crystal, when activated by a concise electrical charge, will vibrate mechanically for a short period until physical equilibrium is established.},

	abstract = {The assessment of adsorbed surfactant mass by quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) monitoring is often complicated due to large bulk responses, particularly for surfactants with high critical micelle concentration (CMC). We present in this work means to interpret QCM-D data that enables the response from the bulk contribution to be separated from the response originating from adsorbed mass. Adsorption of two surfactants, Triton X100 and C12AspNa2 with low and high CMCs, respectively, at the gold?liquid interface surface has been evaluated. Two different approaches to quantify the bulk response are compared. The first approach involves the use of a nonadsorbing surface (silica), yielding a calibration curve for the concentration dependent bulk response. The second method is based on the fact that the overtone-dependent QCM-D response that originates from changes in the bulk differs from that induced by the adsorbed layer of the surfactants. Under the reasonable assumption that the bulk solution and the adsorbed surfactants can be treated as a Newtonian liquid and an acoustically rigid film, it is demonstrated that the bulk contribution can be quantified without control measurements involving inert surfaces. An excellent agreement between the two methods is reported.},

	abstract = {When a contact lens is compressed between two parallel plates (PPC) or under a central load (CLC), the constitutive relation depends not only on the mechanical properties such as elastic modulus, E, of the hydrogel materials, but also the lens power, d, or thickness variation, h($\phi$0), along the meridional direction $\phi$0. Hyperopic lenses (d\&gt;0) are thicker at the apex along the optical axis and thin out gradually along the meridian, while myopic lenses (d\&lt;0) are thinnest at the apex. Mechanical deformation is quantified by the inter-relationship between applied force, F, vertical displacement of the external load, w0, contact or dimple radius, a, and the deformed profile, w(r). Force responses show that lenses with positive d are apparently stiffer in the initial loading but become more compliant as load increases. Conversely, lenses with negative d are more deformable initially and becomes gradually more resistant to loading. This is consistent with the theoretical shell model using the same E. The mechanical behavior has significant impacts in defining the degree of comfort of contact lenses as well as the lens adhesion to the corneal epithelium.},

In the latter case, amphiphilic brushes of block{\textendash}gradient copolymers PAA-b-(PAA-grad-PS) comprising one PAA block and one block with the gradient sequence of AA and S were obtained. The block{\textendash}gradient copolymers are initiated from the surface by the start of the PAA block. The brushes were characterized by XPS and ellipsometry. 1H NMR confirmed the gradient sequence of the PAA-grad-PS copolymer block. The pH- and electro-responsive properties of the brushes were studied by quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) in combination with electrochemistry. This method provides evidence of swelling of the PAA brushes proportional to the contour length of the chains at elevated pH, whereas the response functions of the block{\textendash}gradient copolymers are more complex and point to intermolecular aggregation in the brush at low pH. Monitoring of the changes in resonance frequency and dissipation of the QCM-D also demonstrates that application of negative voltage to the substrate leads to swelling of the brush; application of a positive voltage provokes only a transient collapse of the brush in proportion to the applied voltage.},
